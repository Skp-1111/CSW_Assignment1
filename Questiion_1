/*Q1. Write a Java code snippet that comprises a Car class and a CarTester class. The Car class 
should define private fields for make and model, along with a parameterized constructor and 
getter/setter methods for these attributes. In the CarTester class, instantiate two instances of 
the Car class: myCar1 with a specified make and model, and myCar2 with null values. After 
instantiation, the CarTester class should retrieve and print the initial make and model of both 
cars. Then, it should set new values for myCar2 using setter methods and print the updated 
make and model.*/
